This is the 5th project carried out during my training in data science. The skills assessed in this project are: 
- Implement the unsupervised learning model adapted to the business problem
- Transform the relevant variables of an unsupervised learning model
- Adapt the hyperparameters of an unsupervised algorithm in order to improve it
- Evaluate the performance of an unsupervised learning model
